# Relic

This is an AI-based software for enhancing biological perception. Our goal is to create a software that can optimize the perceptual abilities of individuals with disabilities, enabling them to better perceive and understand the world around them.

## Setup
To install and set up the project, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project from GitHub using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dlcg-Lab/Relic-bilogical-perception-enhancement.git
```

2. Navigate to the `deepdanbooru_onnx` directory:
```
cd deepdanbooru_onnx/
```

3. Install the deepdanbooru_onnx package using pip:
```
pip install deepdanbooru_onnx
```

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
cd..
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can utilize the software as follows:
```
python main.py
```

## References
This project utilizes the [deepdanbooru_onnx](https://github.com/chinoll/deepdanbooru_onnx) project, which offers a convenient way to extract tags from images using deep learning techniques.

Additionally, we make use of the gpt-3.5-turbo model to convert the extracted image tags into descriptive text. gpt-3.5-turbo is a powerful language model that can generate human-like responses based on input prompts.

Please refer to the respective GitHub repositories and website for more information on above projects.
